Removed the method ``get_state_as_file_object`` from the ``Driver`` class and its child classes; ``FeatureScheduler`` and ``Sequential``.
While investigating the memory leak with the scheduler (see OBS-1431) I realized that the issue was creating the ``io.BytesIO`` to store the data for the scheduler state.
To fix this we consolidate all that operation in the ``Driver.save_state`` and ``Driver.reset_from_state``.

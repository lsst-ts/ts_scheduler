Welcome to LSST Scheduler's documentation!
==========================================

The LSST Scheduler is the software responsible for autonomously coordinating the observations generated by a set of
scheduling algorithms with the Observatory Control System (OCS), as well as with the simulated environment (SOCS).
You can find information about the properties of the LSST Scheduler and the simulation environment on these links:

    * Science Requirements Document:

    * etc:

Here you will find information about how to setup the LSST Scheduler with special focus on simulations and the use of
the API to enable different scheduling algorithms.

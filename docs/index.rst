Welcome to LSST Scheduler's documentation!
==========================================

The LSST Scheduler is the software responsible for autonomously coordinating the observations generated by a set of
scheduling algorithms with the Observatory Control System (OCS), as well as with the simulated environment (SOCS).
You can find information about the simulation environment `here <https://lsst-sims.github.io/sims_ocs/index.html>`_.

In these pages you will find information about the structure and workflow of the LSST Scheduler, with special focus on
the use of the API to enable different scheduling algorithms.
